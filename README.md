# Node-Express-Handlebars
In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.
The work of an app should be following the structure chart like this..

Here are the few things you need to know about....
1. The app has to let the user input the names of burgers it likes to eat.
2. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the he name of the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
3. There's the devour it button that can move the name of the left side.
4. The app will store every burger in a database. To be devoured or not to be devoured? That is the question!
